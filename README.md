External Links
==============

Customise the display and functionality of links to external websites or email
addresses on your site. You can:
- Display an icon next to external/mailto links
- Open external links in a new window/tab
- Show a popup message when clicking on external links

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > User
  Interface > External links (`admin/config/user-interface/extlink`) to
  fine-tune the settings.

A note about the CSS
--------------------

This module adds a CSS file that is only a few lines in length. You may choose
to move this CSS to your theme to prevent the file from needing to be loaded
separately. To do this:

1. Open the `.info` file for your theme and add this line of code to prevent the
   `extlink.css` file from loading:
   `stylesheets[all][] = extlink.css`

2. Copy all the code from this module's `css/extlink.css` file into your theme's
   CSS file.

3. Copy the `images/extlink.png` and `images/mailto.png` files to your theme's
   directory.

Note that you DO NOT need to make an `extlink.css` file in your theme.
Specifying the file in your theme's `.info` file is enough to tell Backdrop not
to load this module's version of the CSS.
